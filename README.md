The initial goal of this project was to build a predictive model that can 
accurately identify whether a customer will churn (i.e., leave the service) based on various customer attributes. 
Churn prediction is crucial for telecommunication companies as retaining existing customers 
is generally more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.
